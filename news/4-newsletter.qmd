The ShareStats project runs from September 1, 2020 to August 31, 2022. In this fourth newsletter we will give you an update about our project!
			
## High turnout at second meeting with teachers 
			
On November 26, 2021, we had another ShareStats professional community meeting. There were more than 20 participants from more than 10 universities or other organizations; a great success!
			
After an introduction by Marike Polak (EUR) about the items created in ShareStats, we discussed some first example questions from the ShareStats database in break-out rooms. We looked both at content and at the taxonomy used. Niels Smits (UvA) then talked about R/Exams and how ShareStats can be used in the future. We were able to immediately take inventory of the wishes of the participants of the meeting who will be using the item bank in the future.
			
The evaluation showed that the participants thought all parts were interesting and instructive. For many, the existence of R/Exams was a real eye-opener and they liked to now have a better view of the entire project. It was striking that apart from the development of the items, the contact with other statistics teachers was highly appreciated. During the meeting, many experiences and educational materials were exchanged. This once again showed the usefulness of creating a professional community! All in all, we had a very enthusiastic and inspiring afternoon.
			
## Over 1500 statistics exercises have been made! 
			
There are already 1500 items ready in R Markdown format at the moment. That's about 25% of the intended 6500 items we want to deliver! Soon, 2000 items from the Statistics Factory (Statistiekfabriek, UvA) will be added in 1 swoop. In April we will deliver a first beta version of the item bank that we will present to the professional community!

## EXPORT TO ONLINE LEARNING AND TESTING ENVIRONMENTS

As part of the ShareStats project, export and import functions are written in R. This way, users of the item bank can easily export questions from R Markdown to an online learning environment or test application of their choice. Think for example of TestVision, Canvas, Remindo, Blackboard and Grasple.

The functions exams2blackboard, exams2canvas and exams2testvision are ready. We are currently working hard on the conversion to Remindo and Grasple. As a result of the meeting with the professional community, wishes have emerged to also develop export functions for other programs (ANS, d2l BrightSpace, Moodle). We are investigating whether these functions can still be made.

## EXAMPLE OF AN ITEM IN THE SHARESTATS ITEMBANK

Item in Rmarkdown

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
Question
========

Een arbeids- en organisatiepsychologe is geïnteresseerd in de relatie tussen de mate van binding met het bedrijf (intervalschaal) en het aantal dagen ziekte in een jaar. In een aselecte steekproef van 30 werknemers vindt zij een correlatie van $r = .37$.

Wat is de nulhypothese wanneer de aanwezigheid van een correlatie getoetst wordt?

Answerlist
----------
* $H_0: r = 0$
* $H_0: r > 0$
* $H_0: \rho = 0$
* $H_0: \rho > 0$

Solution
========
  
Een hypothese is een statement over de waarde in de populatie ($\rho$). In een nulhypothese staat altijd dat er géén correlatie is: ($\rho=0$).

Answerlist
----------
* Een hypothese is een statement over de waarde in de populatie en niet in de steekproef.
* Een hypothese is een statement over de waarde in de populatie en niet in de steekproef.
* Dit is de juiste nulhypothese.
* In een nulhypothese staat altijd dat er géén correlatie is.

## In the spotlight

ShareStats is an initiative of five departments of four universities. In every newsletter we introduce one of the project members.

### Niels Smits (University of Amsterdam)

![Niels Smits](../team/people/images/niels.jpg){width=200 style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;"}

I am an assistant professor in the department of pedagogical and educational sciences. I have been teaching methods and techniques for almost 20 years. Think of courses such as research methodology, statistics and test theory. When it comes to education, I get my inspiration from good statistics books. There are a number of authors who are very good at telling a conceptual story while omitting distracting technical details. I also do research; my interests are in the field of psychometrics. I've written the most about adaptive testing and test construction.

For the project I mainly work on the output functions in R/Exams. In addition to the planned output formats, I also think about conversion to new test applications and the conversion the other way, for example, convert collections of questions that are in TestVision to R/Exams format. I have already contributed to the development ofthe R/Exams package in the past and now I can spend even more time on it. I especially like programming and enjoy creating questions/items that not only look beautiful, but also in such a way that students can learn something from it. In addition, I hope that through my efforts statistics teachers will not only use the collection of questions produced by ShareStats, but also create their own questions in our format so that they can benefit from the possibility of interchangeability and efficient question management.
