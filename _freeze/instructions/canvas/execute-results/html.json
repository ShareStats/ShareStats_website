Follow the instructions below on how to upload the zip file to Canvas.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/31OItmHCxrA?si=d3V8z8qO16UQMC2Q\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n## Create Canvas package\n\nIt is also possible to download the **ZIP Folder** with all the raw files from the [itembank search page](https://www.sharestats.nl/items-df.html). When you unpack the zip you will have a folder containing the item `.Rmd` file, and data or image files.\n\nWe recommend to create a folder for your items and set this to your working directory and save the extracted ZIP folders in there. In this folder you can ad an R file with the code below to compile the items for uploading.\n\nFor compiling the items to a Canvas ZIP you can use the `exams2canvas` function from the exams package. Make sure to first install the exams package to R if you do not have it installed already.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"exams\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nYou can use the script below to compile a question. Note that you can also download multiple questions and combine them to upload multiple questions at once to canvas.\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n## Single Question\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(\"exams\")\n\n# Add file path to list. Multiple paths can be added here list(\"path1.rmd\", \"path2.rmd\")\nfile.paths <- list(\"itemFolder1/itemFile1.rmd\")\n\n# Create preview\nexams2html(file.paths)\n\n# Set directory where you want to store the .zip package that will be created\ndirectory <- getwd()\n\n# Create TvO package\nexams2canvas(file.paths, \n                 dir  = directory, \n                 name = \"exam_name\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Multiple Questions\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(\"exams\")\n\n# Add file path to list.
