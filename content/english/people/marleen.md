As the general project leader of ShareStats I will be responsible for the planning and progress of the project. In addition, knowledge dissemination is one of my tasks: setting up an active subject community to involve as many teachers as possible in Sharestats, and to keep teachers informed about our milestones! My motto for ShareStats is “The whole is greater than the sum of its parts”. Mathematically, that might not be right, but I hope it works that way for our project! Working together on a database of statistical statements increases the quality of our teaching materials and saves teachers time!
