As chairman of SURF's special interest group for digital assessments, I have seen over the past 10 years how difficult it is to share assessment items. Despite the available standards, exchange between testing applications is still a challenge. ShareStats should become the source that can be loaded into any test application. I will work on the quality model and make test questions from an earlier SURF project, the statistics factory, suitable for ShareStats.
