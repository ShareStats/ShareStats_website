For years we have been trying to come up with fun, new, original statistics questions at all kinds of study programs and universities. Seeing each other as partners and colleagues, instead of competitors, opens the door to joining forces and ideas so that we jointly achieve better statistics education for all our students. When touch becomes connecting, cooperation follows naturally.
