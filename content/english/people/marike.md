Together with Dimitris I coordinate the review and revision of statistical statements. With this we ensure that the already available assignments of all participating universities are drawn up in accordance with agreed quality requirements and can be included in the freely accessible item bank. I am looking forward to the exchange with lecturers from other universities. By sharing statistical problems openly, we learn from each other and make each other and our students stronger!
