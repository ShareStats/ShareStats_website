In this project I mainly focus on writing R code to extend the functionality of the exams package. With this I hope to achieve that users have a greater choice in the digital learning or testing environment that they want to use for offering the practice and testing material. It is great that we are no longer dependent on a commercial party or software provider for the creation of our study material!
