    "text": "Als voorzitter van de special interest group digitaal toetsen van SURF heb ik de afgelopen 10 jaar gezien hoe lastig het is om toetsitems te delen. Ondanks de beschikbare standaarden is uitwisseling tussen toetsapplicaties nog steeds een uitdaging. ShareStats moet de bron worden die in iedere toetsapplicatie ingeladen kan worden. Ik zal me bezig houden met het kwaliteitsmodel en toetsvragen uit een eerder SURF project, de statistiek fabriek, geschikt maken voor ShareStats."

(By underlining the negative.)\n\nMake sure it is impossible to interpret the question in different ways or with multiple meanings.\n\nQuestions should not assess the correctness of two statements at once.\nQuestions should not have a possibility to supply a different answer than intended. (Play the devil’s advocate, analyze the different meanings terms in the question could possibly have.)\n\nHave universal quantifiers (never, all, always) been used correctly?\n\nIn the phrasing of the question.\nIn the phrasing of the answers.\n\nIs there a solid connection between the answers and the question?\n\nThe phrasing of each answer ties in with the question.\nPreferably integrate as many words into the question instead of restating them in each of the answer alternatives.\n\nAre the answer alternatives exclusive, logical, and clear?\n\nNo wrong answers that can be defended as right answers.\nAvoid, where possible, dummy-alternatives (for example ‘none of the above’).\nNo unintentional directions to either a wrong answer or the correct answer.\nAvoid answer alternatives that rely on a logical inaccuracy.\nAvoid nonsensical alternative answers as much as possible. (Alternative answers that most people would know are untrue/incorrect.)\n\n\nLayout\n\nNo grammar or spelling errors.\nAll figures and graphs are clear and easy to read.\nPunctuation marks such as comma’s, periods, semicolons, etc. are all checked and placed correctly.\nBe consistent in your placement of periods in multiple choice answers: o Numbers and few words require no period at the end of the answer. o Fully formed sentences and phrases do require a period at the end of the answer.\nWhen using an external source (for example graphs, figures or datasets), the proper citation is given. Copyright and Creative Commons No questions protected under copyright are to be added to the item bank. (Questions originating from a published book, or clearly derived questions, datasets, graphs and figures from books or other materials protected under copyright law.) Check the source of the question before adding it to the item bank. Ask your faculty’s project coordinator which sources have possibly been used (for example textbooks from courses, or online materials). Is it original material? Then the item may be added. When in doubt use the following as a basis and consult your project coordinator about the admissibility of the question:\n\nWhen only changing certain objective elements of the question, it falls under partial processing or imitation in a modified form, which still falls under copyright infringement.\nWhen writing a question in another order or with a different/new question, but with similar elements, it does not full under copyright infringement."

Oftentimes multiple questions are asked about the same case/description.\n\n\nExample:: NA\n\n\nConceptual\n\n\nBasic question asking about simple facts.\n\n\nExample:: Which of the following properties is not a condition for establishing a causal relationship? a. Alternative explanations for the relationship between cause and effect can be excluded. b. The data shall be collected with a randomized experiment. c. There must be a relationship between the cause and the effect. d. The cause must precede the effect in time.\n\n\nCreating graphs\n\n\nThe student is asked to create a graph using data supplied with the question (either by hand or using a program).\n\n\nExample:: NA\n\n\nData manipulation\n\n\nThe student is asked to combine data, screen data, create new variables in a dataset, or calculate descriptive statistics using the data supplied with the question.\n\n\nExample:: NA\n\n\nInterpreting graph\n\n\nThe graph is supplied with the question. The student is asked to look at the graph and describe what is going on, draw conclusions based on the graph, etc.\n\n\nExample:: NA\n\n\nInterpreting output\n\n\nThe output is either supplied with the question or the student has run an analysis to create the output (combine with “Performing analysis”). The student is asked to look at the output and report results/draw conclusions based on it.\n\n\nExample:: NA\n\n\nPerforming analysis\n\n\nThe student is asked to conduct an analysis using a statistical program (combine with program type).\n\n\nExample:: NA\n\n\nTest choice\n\n\nThe student is presented with a description of research/study and is aksed to choose which hypotheses test should be used.\n\n\nExample:: A researcher randomly assigns 100 students to a control group and an experimental group. All students take a math test. Half of the students in each group take the test on paper and half of the students take the test on a computer. The researcher determines the number of correctly answered questions for each student. With which technique should the researcher analyze his data? a. ANOVA b. Cross-table analysis c. Two-way ANOVA d. ANCOVA\n\n\nLevel descriptions\n\nStatistical Literacy (Bloom: Knowing)\n\n\nIdentify, Describe, Translate, Interpret, Read, Compute\n\n\nExample: Understanding and using the basic language and tools of statistics: knowing what basic statistical terms mean, understanding the use of simple statistical symbols, and recognizing and being able to interpret different representations of data\n\n\nStatistical Reasoning (Bloom: Comprehending)\n\n\nExplain why, Explain how\n\n\nExample: The way people reason with statistical ideas and make sense of statistical information. Statistical reasoning may involve connecting one concept to another (e.g., center and spread) or combining ideas about data and chance. Statistical reasoning involves understanding concepts at a deeper level than literacy, such as understanding why a sampling distribution becomes more normal as the sample size increases. Reasoning also means understanding and being able to explain statistical processes and being able to interpret particular statistical results (e.g., why a mean is much larger or smaller than a median, given the presence of an outlier).\n\n\nStatistical Thinking (Bloom: Application, Analysis, Synthesis, and Evaluation)\n\n\nApply, Critique, Evaluate, Generalize\n\n\nExample: Involves a higher order of thinking than does statistical reasoning. Statistical thinking has been described as the way professional statisticians think. It includes knowing how and why to use a particular method, measure, design or statistical model; deep understanding of the theories underlying statistical processes and methods; as well as understanding the constraints and limitations of statistics and statistical inference. Statistical thinking is also about understanding how statistical models are used to represent random phenomena, understanding how data are produced to estimate probabilities, recognizing how, when, and why to use inferential tools in solving a statistical problem, and being able to understand and utilize the context of a problem to plan and evaluate investigations and to draw conclusions"
