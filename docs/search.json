We are going to reuse and adopt existing material for this purpose.\nThe statistics exercises can be used by instructors from the professional community in a simple way by selecting and exporting exercises to a digital learning or test environment such as Canvas, Blackboard, TestVision, Remindo and Grasple."

    "text": "What will we start with?\nIn the coming months we will start developing a quality model and taxonomy. A quality model is needed to assess the existing statistics exercises on quality in order to determine whether an exercise can be included in the database or possibly still needs to be revised. A taxonomy is necessary to meta-date the exercises so that they can be found by, for example, subject or type."

What is the value of Cohen’s d?\n\n\nCase\n\n\nQuestions that belong to a longer description of a research study. Oftentimes multiple questions are asked about the same case/description.\n\n\nExample:: NA\n\n\nConceptual\n\n\nBasic question asking about simple facts.\n\n\nExample:: Which of the following properties is not a condition for establishing a causal relationship? a. Alternative explanations for the relationship between cause and effect can be excluded. b. The data shall be collected with a randomized experiment. c. There must be a relationship between the cause and the effect. d. The cause must precede the effect in time.\n\n\nCreating graphs\n\n\nThe student is asked to create a graph using data supplied with the question (either by hand or using a program).\n\n\nExample:: NA\n\n\nData manipulation\n\n\nThe student is asked to combine data, screen data, create new variables in a dataset, or calculate descriptive statistics using the data supplied with the question.\n\n\nExample:: NA\n\n\nInterpreting graph\n\n\nThe graph is supplied with the question. The student is asked to look at the graph and describe what is going on, draw conclusions based on the graph, etc.\n\n\nExample:: NA\n\n\nInterpreting output\n\n\nThe output is either supplied with the question or the student has run an analysis to create the output (combine with “Performing analysis”). The student is asked to look at the output and report results/draw conclusions based on it.\n\n\nExample:: NA\n\n\nPerforming analysis\n\n\nThe student is asked to conduct an analysis using a statistical program (combine with program type).\n\n\nExample:: NA\n\n\nTest choice\n\n\nThe student is presented with a description of research/study and is aksed to choose which hypotheses test should be used.\n\n\nExample:: A researcher randomly assigns 100 students to a control group and an experimental group. All students take a math test. Half of the students in each group take the test on paper and half of the students take the test on a computer. The researcher determines the number of correctly answered questions for each student. With which technique should the researcher analyze his data? a. ANOVA b. Cross-table analysis c. Two-way ANOVA d. ANCOVA\n\n\nLevel descriptions\n\nStatistical Literacy (Bloom: Knowing)\n\n\nIdentify, Describe, Translate, Interpret, Read, Compute\n\n\nExample: Understanding and using the basic language and tools of statistics: knowing what basic statistical terms mean, understanding the use of simple statistical symbols, and recognizing and being able to interpret different representations of data\n\n\nStatistical Reasoning (Bloom: Comprehending)\n\n\nExplain why, Explain how\n\n\nExample: The way people reason with statistical ideas and make sense of statistical information. Statistical reasoning may involve connecting one concept to another (e.g., center and spread) or combining ideas about data and chance. Statistical reasoning involves understanding concepts at a deeper level than literacy, such as understanding why a sampling distribution becomes more normal as the sample size increases. Reasoning also means understanding and being able to explain statistical processes and being able to interpret particular statistical results (e.g., why a mean is much larger or smaller than a median, given the presence of an outlier).\n\n\nStatistical Thinking (Bloom: Application, Analysis, Synthesis, and Evaluation)\n\n\nApply, Critique, Evaluate, Generalize\n\n\nExample: Involves a higher order of thinking than does statistical reasoning. Statistical thinking has been described as the way professional statisticians think. It includes knowing how and why to use a particular method, measure, design or statistical model; deep understanding of the theories underlying statistical processes and methods; as well as understanding the constraints and limitations of statistics and statistical inference. Statistical thinking is also about understanding how statistical models are used to represent random phenomena, understanding how data are produced to estimate probabilities, recognizing how, when, and why to use inferential tools in solving a statistical problem, and being able to understand and utilize the context of a problem to plan and evaluate investigations and to draw conclusions"
